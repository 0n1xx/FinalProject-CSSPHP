# Marketplace of iPods:

## Description:
- The project is a dynamic website which has been built using PHP, MySQL, HTML and CSS.
- It consists of two sides:
    - Public view: the client can see what is on the website, can open a separated product card;
    - Backend view (admin): allows admins to add new products, customize existing ones;

## Technologies:
- Frontend: HTML, CSS
- Backend: PHP (templating, sessions, CRUD)
- Database: MySQL (admin and product tables)
- Version Control: Git & GitHub
